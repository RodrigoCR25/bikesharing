# Summary

The indexes in cycling are mostly male users, which represent a total of 81%.

Therefore, two strategies are suggested:

Continue to focus on the current target, which is the male gender, and ensure the correct marketing for this group.

Launch promotions focused on attracting the female gender to participate in hours of low demand.
